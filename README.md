# Toy-Language-Interpreter
During a very interesting course called Advanced Methods of Programming, I had to create a project in Java consisting of doing a Toy Language Interpreter. 
This project helped me to better understand OOP concepts, concurrency and memory management. This project includes an implementation of a toy semaphore and also provides a GUI.
